# Custom Spanish Dvorak

Layout in Spanish designed mainly to avoid fatigue the hands minimizing the displacement and bad postures of the fingers. To achieve this we have opted for the creation of a layout based on dvorak where most of the modifiers or recurring keys that I use when programming are as close as possible to the default position of the fingers.

This code is based on the result of the [Oryz](https://configure.zsa.io/moonlander) visual generator with some modifications since it is not possible to achieve some things through the GUI:

- Hold down a key with a modifier, mainly to resize the tmux panels by holding down ctrl-b.

The latest Oryz Moonlander layout could be found [here](https://configure.zsa.io/moonlander/layouts/yEyKr/latest).
